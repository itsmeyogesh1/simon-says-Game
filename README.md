**Simon Says Game Description**

"Simon Says" is a classic children's game that promotes listening skills, attention, and quick reflexes. One player, known as "Simon," gives commands that players must follow only if prefaced with the phrase "Simon says." For example, "Simon says touch your toes!" Players must then touch their toes. If Simon gives a command without saying "Simon says," such as "Jump in place," players who follow the command are out of the game.

The objective is to be the last player standing by carefully listening and only responding to commands that begin with "Simon says." The game can be played indoors or outdoors and is perfect for groups of any size. It's a fun way to encourage physical activity, enhance coordination, and engage in friendly competition!
